Yale EDS Certificate Capstone 2025

Which municipalities in Rhode Island, based on their available agricultural land, exhibit the greatest potential for successful Agrivoltaics (AV) adoption in terms of simultaneously maximizing local food production (e.g., specific high-value crops or animal grazing) and diversifying farmer revenue streams through energy streams? 

# Questions to be Answered
-	What is the total potential of available agricultural land in each municipality, which can be measured by acreage of unprotected agricultural land that is suitable for large scale solar development?
-	How do the average annual revenues per acre of US farms with existing agrivoltaics systems compare to similar, conventional farms, considering crop sales, energy sales, and installation/operational costs?
-	How would the adoption of Agrivoltaics impact the total municipal renewable energy generation capacity and what percentage of local energy demand could this supply?
